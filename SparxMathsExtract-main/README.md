# Installation
> [!IMPORTANT]
> This extension only works on Chromium browsers. (Chrome, Edge, Opera, etc.).
> I may plan on adding support for Firefox in the future, but there's no promises.

1. Download the extension by pressing the green `Code` button at the top-right of all the files. Click `Download ZIP`.
2. Open the ZIP download and extract all files into a new folder.
3. Navigate to your browser's extension page. If you don't know how to do that, search for your browser's extension page.
4. Enable `Developer mode`. (toggle it on, usually at the top-right corner).
5. Click `Load unpacked` and navigate & select the folder which you extracted everything to.

The Sparx-Extract tool should be in your extensions now.

# Usage
1. Go to your Sparx question.
2. Open up the extension.
3. Copy the text under the `Sparx question` heading. (If it doesn't show for some reason, check you have given it the right permissions, else open an [issue](https://github.com/Sparxist/SparxMathsExtract/issues) up.)
4. If you intend to put the question into an AI, copy the text under `AI initial prompt`. You only have to do this initially.
5. Get some tips that can make Sparx less of a pain by reading the `Tips & Tricks on Sparx`.
