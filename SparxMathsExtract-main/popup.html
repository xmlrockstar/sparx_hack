        <div class="prompt">
            <p>Below are math questions written in a mix of normal language and LaTeX.</p>
            <p>- ALWAYS give an exact answer even if the question says otherwise.</p>
            <p>- NEVER approximate. You are bad at approximating so leave any form of decimal multiplication or division alone. I will put it in a calculator. </p>
            <p>- If the question asks you to give an explanation, proof or to show something, ALWAYS RESPOND with 'I have written/shown an explanation/proof' with NO further elaboration or explanation.</p>
            <p>- Work out each question concisely, with minimum intermediate steps.</p>
            <p>- At the end of your answer, go through every question and write the final answer in a LaTeX box.</p>

        <div class="tricks">
            <p>Press <i>'Escape'</i> when on a bookwork check to <strong>reroll the options</strong>. Focus on an option and try to find it every time you press <i>Escape</i>. If it seems to be consistently there, it is likely that it is the <strong>correct option</strong>.</p>
            <p>If your Sparx question contains an image, <strong>describe the image's key points</strong> (e.g. lengths, options) to the AI.</p>
